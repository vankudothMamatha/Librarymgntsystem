A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a library. It helps manage essential tasks such as cataloging books, maintaining user records, tracking borrowed and returned items, and organizing inventory efficiently. By replacing manual processes with digital tools, the system reduces errors, saves time, and enhances the overall user experience for both librarians and members. An LMS also supports features like searching the catalog, reserving books, sending notifications for due dates, and generating reports, making it an essential tool for modern libraries to operate smoothly and effectively.
